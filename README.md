# Jaundice rebound calculator

Based on the formula in Chang PW, Kuzniewicz MW, McCulloch CE, Newman TB. **A clinical prediction rule for rebound hyperbilirubinemia following inpatient phototherapy.** --Pediatrics.-- 2017;139(3):e20162896

The calculator is written in python then called from the index page. You can see a demo at [my site](http://jaundice.gri.gg).

I derived the formulas for the risk stratification treatment lines from the AAP 2004 guidelines. I wasn't able to find an actual formula for the lines so modelled them as best I could. You can see them in the python script.
